                            <strong>C++</strong> was developed in the early 1980s by Bjarne Stroustrup.The first version of 
                            C++ was released in 1985.

                            <strong>C++</strong> programs can run really fast because they're closer to the hardware. This

code written in C++ can often be easily ported to run on different devices or 
operating systems.
